Create a plaintext file with no more than 100 chars on each line.(we call it sample.txt)\r\n2. Navigate to the folder with the script.\r\n3. `mkdir images pages`\r\n4. `python get_hand.py sample.txt`\r\n5. `python make_page.py`\r\n\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n\r\n![Example of handwriting](example.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Info\r\n---------\r\n\r\n[The paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850)  \r\n[The man behind it all.
